                  I got into cocktails in my late 20s. It all started during a
                  night out in Canada, when a friend ordered an Old Fashioned. I
                  had no idea what it was, but I ordered one too - and instantly
                  got hooked. When I got back home, I tried making one... then
                  made another... and another.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It began with a basic bottle of whiskey, but you know how
                  these things go - one thing led to another, and now I've got
                  over 20 different spirits. Add in syrups, a shaker, strainer,
                  crushed ice bag, wooden mallet - yeah, it escalated quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I love exploring new flavors, experimenting with techniques,
                  and chasing that perfect balance between boozy, sweet, and
                  bitter.
