                <p>
                  Coding came into my life as a normal extension to my
                  curiosity. It all began when I tried to figure out how to set
                  up a private MMORPG server. After that, I stumbled into the
                  .tk boom and, at 17, launched my own site:
                  phpandhtmllearning.tk. Realistically, I was the one doing the
                  learning, not the teaching - but it got me hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was lucky enough to have a teacher who reignited my passion
                  for coding at a time I let it fade. Without her, there's a
                  good chance I'd be doing something entirely different today.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, coding is both how I earn a living and what I love doing.
                  I try to stay in the loop by watching tech YouTubers and
                  occasionally scrolling the tech side of Twitter (X).

                This site is my little masterpiece - a playground where I've
                learned and built a bunch of things I'd been meaning to explore:
